# 🧮 Roman Numerical Calculator

A simple, interactive web-based **Roman Numeral Converter** that allows users to input a number (between 1 and 3999) and instantly view its equivalent in Roman numerals.  
This project demonstrates JavaScript logic, input validation, and DOM manipulation in a clean, user-friendly interface.

---

## 📖 Description

The **Roman Numerical Calculator** converts standard Arabic numerals (e.g., 10, 56, 2023) into their Roman numeral representations (e.g., X, LVI, MMXXIII).  
It provides real-time feedback, validating user input and displaying error messages for invalid or out-of-range values.  

This project is ideal for learning **JavaScript fundamentals**, including:
- Loops and conditionals  
- DOM manipulation  
- Event handling  
- Input validation

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔢 **Instant Conversion**: Converts any number between 1 and 3999 into Roman numerals.  
- ⚙️ **Input Validation**: Detects invalid, negative, or empty inputs and displays user-friendly messages.  
- 🧰 **Lightweight and Fast**: No external libraries required — pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- 🧑‍💻 **Interactive UI**: Responsive layout and clear on-screen feedback.  
- 🧪 **Error Handling**: Prevents conversion if input is missing or invalid.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — Structure and markup  
- **CSS3** — Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** — Logic and DOM interaction

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

You can modify the following settings directly in the code:

| Option           | Description                                | Location                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `numberInput`    | Sets the user input field ID               | `index.html`                  |
| `convertBtn`     | Sets the button ID used for event listener | `main.js`                     |
| `output`         | ID of the element displaying results       | `index.html`                  |
| Validation Range | Accepts values 1–3999                      | `getuserInput()` in `main.js` |

## 🧰 Troubleshooting

| Issue                                              | Possible Cause                    | Solution                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Please enter a valid number”                      | Non-numeric or empty input        | Enter a numeric value (e.g., 25)                        |
| “Please enter a number greater than or equal to 1” | Input is zero or negative         | Enter a value between 1–3999                            |
| “Please enter a number less than or equal to 3999” | Input exceeds Roman numeral limit | Reduce the input value                                  |
| Output not updating                                | Button event not attached         | Ensure `convertBtn` ID matches your button’s ID in HTML |

Would you like me to make this README ready for **GitHub Markdown rendering** (with clickable sections and badges like “Built with JavaScript”)? It would make your project page look much more polished.
